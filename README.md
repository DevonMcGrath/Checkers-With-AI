# Checkers-With-AI
A checkers game with some basic AI. The AI works by checking every move possible, assigning a weight to each move, then taking the move with the highest weight. If more than one move has the highest weight, then one of the moves will be randomly selected. This guarantees that the game will be random and makes the AI less predictable.
